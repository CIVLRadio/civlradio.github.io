The original CIVL technical infrastructure was mainly assembled by Doug McLean, Ben Cadieux, and John Henderson, among others. The modern CIVL infrastructure descends from this invaluable work.

For the modern systems:

- **[Emma Hones](https://twitter.com/EmmainBC)** spearheaded the research and planning behind the purchase of new servers, workstations, network equipment - the works. She also did much of the actual installation and setup work, as well as being the only contributor to actually live in Abbotsford and be a formal CIVL volunteer.
- **[Saoirse Ó Catháin](https://twitter.com/HereBeSaoirse)** helped out with migrating content from old systems to new, plus implementing filesystem layouts and generally keeping things clean and pristine.
- **[Anastasia Mayer](https://twitter.com/ac0rN_KI5JRA)** contributed her coding expertise to help with the new nowplaying.py script, as well as other bits and pieces of useful advice and support.
- **[Gabriel McMillan](https://twitter.com/fearxzombie)** helped keep Emma and co. sane, and assisted with planning and installing new network equipment.
- **[Vincent Maggard](https://twitter.com/vincentmaggard)** also helped keep Emma and co. sane.
